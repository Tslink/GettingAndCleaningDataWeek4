Geeting and Cleaning Week 4 Data project

1.) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Transformation and Data

Since the column headers, values, and subject information were all contained in seperated files a few things had to be done.

Clean up the multiple files and combined the set information, the subject id and the values (this was for both Training and test)

##Clean UP

Create a regex expression to pull out all field headers that included std or mean since the column headers had a various other characters included in the name.

## Variables
The following  variables were output to the project.
